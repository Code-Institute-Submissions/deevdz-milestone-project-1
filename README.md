Headford Wellbeing Centre - Responsive Website
======================================
My friend has her own business, Headford Wellbeing Centre. She currently has a website but this site is not responsive.

With an increasing number of students to her centre now using mobiles to view her site, I felt that she required a responsive website with a new look and feel.

UX
-----------------------------------------
This website is for both new and existing students to the Headford Wellbeing Centre. 

Users to this site are looking for the following information:
- Find out about the centre -> Teachers, Classes Offered, Images of the Centre
- Find out where exactly the centre is -> Address and a map to the centre
- Find out when classes are on -> Timetables and Prices of classes
- Find out about workshops -> Timetable of workshops, descriptions, prices, location
- Find out about future classes/workshops -> Call to action sign up form to receive information via email
- Contact Details for centre -> Phone no., Address, Email Address
