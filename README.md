Headford Wellbeing Centre - Responsive Website
======================================
My friend has her own business, Headford Wellbeing Centre. She currently has a website but this site is not responsive.

With an increasing number of students to her centre now using mobiles to view her site, I felt that she required a responsive website with a new look and feel.

UX
-----------------------------------------
This website is for both new and existing students to the Headford Wellbeing Centre. 

Users to this site are looking for the following information:
- Find out about the centre -> Teachers, Classes Offered, Images of the Centre
- Find out where exactly the centre is -> Address and a map to the centre
- Find out when classes are on -> Timetables and Prices of classes
- Find out information about the different types of classes on offer at the centre
- Find out about workshops -> Timetable of workshops, descriptions, prices, location
- Find out about future classes/workshops -> Call to action sign up form to receive information via email
- Contact Details for centre -> Phone no., Address, Email Address

Features
-----------------------------------------
**Homepage Slider**

To add some interaction to the site - each slide links to the most visited/popular pages on the site (this was based on google analytics of current site) and new classes offered.

**Newsletter Signup Form**

Added an option for students to signup to a regular newsletter from the centre. This signup is intergrated with a MailChimp list.

**Footer Modal Box - Google Map**
I've created a link in the footer that allows user to click and open a modal box with the location of the centre pinned on a Google Map.

**Classes - What do I need Page - Accordian**

Essentially a FAQ section that allows user to dropdown the information that is relevant to them.

**Timetable - Responsive Table**

I have made the timetable table responsive using bootstrap to allow users to easily review the timetable.

**Contact Form**

I've added a contact form to the Contact Us Page with required fields and a checkbox to cover GDPR.


Future Features
-----------------
- I would like to make the contact form actually send the information to either an email address or database.
- Take online bookings for workshops
- Take online bookings for classes
- Add a lightbox feature to the masonary galleries that would allow users to view a bigger version of the image in a lighbox.


Technologies Used
-----------------------------------------
This website uses 
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript (Custom javascript for displaying google map - credit below)
4. Bootstrap v4.1.3 - https://getbootstrap.com/
5. JQuery v3.3.1 
6. Google Maps API
7. Font Awesome
8. Google Fonts


Testing
-----------------------------------------
I have tested the site across multiple browsers and mobile devices. As this site is using the bootstrap framework I am confident that it is responsive.

**Areas of concern when testing were the following:**
1. Homepage Slider - I have tested that this is working across multiple browsers and mobile devices. I have made changes to the size of the slider based on screen size and also what information is displayed.
2. Navigation - I have tested that the navigation changes to a burger menu on mobile devices and that the dropdown menu is working as expected.
3. What do I need page - I have tested that the accordian is working as it should across all browsers and mobile devices.
4. Timetable page - The responsive table is working as expected with a scroll bar appearing on smaller devices to allow users to see the contents of the table at a resonable size.
5. Map in Modal Box in Footer - I have tested the functionality of this feature across all browsers and devices and it is working as it should. Allowing users to open a modal box, view the location on a map and then exit out of the modal box by clicking on the close button.
6. Call to action - Newsletter sign up at the bottom of the pages - I have incorporated mailchimp code to allow users to add themselves to an existing mailing list. I have tested this feature by successfully adding one of my email addresses to the list.
7. Contact Form on the Contact page - I have tested that you cannot submit the form without entering the required fields. These include Name, Email address and a checkbox consenting to data being stored in line with a privacy policy.
8. Google Map on Contact Page - I have tested that the map is displaying a map pin to the correct location across all browsers and devices. Initially this map was confliciting with the map in the modal box but with some tweaking of the code this issue is now resolved.
