Headford Wellbeing Centre - Responsive Website
======================================
My friend has her own business, Headford Wellbeing Centre. She currently has a website but this site is not responsive.

With an increasing number of students to her centre now using mobiles to view her site, I felt that she required a responsive website with a new look and feel.

UX
-----------------------------------------
This website is for both new and existing students to the Headford Wellbeing Centre. 

Users to this site are looking for the following information:
- Find out about the centre -> Teachers, Classes Offered, Images of the Centre
- Find out where exactly the centre is -> Address and a map to the centre
- Find out when classes are on -> Timetables and Prices of classes
- Find out information about the different types of classes on offer at the centre
- Find out about workshops -> Timetable of workshops, descriptions, prices, location
- Find out about future classes/workshops -> Call to action sign up form to receive information via email
- Contact Details for centre -> Phone no., Address, Email Address

Features
-----------------------------------------
**Homepage Slider**

To add some interaction to the site - each slide links to the most visited/popular pages on the site (this was based on google analytics of current site) and new classes offered.

**Newsletter Signup Form**

Added an option for students to signup to a regular newsletter from the centre. This signup is intergrated with a MailChimp list.

**Footer Modal Box - Google Map**

Allows user to click link in footer to open a modal box with the location of the centre pinned on a Google Map.

**Masonry Galleries**

Masonry gallery layout optimizes the use of space inside the web page by reducing any unnecessary gaps and allows images of varying sizes to be displayed elegantly.

**Classes - What do I need Page - Accordian**

Essentially a FAQ section that allows user to dropdown the information that is relevant to them.

**Timetable - Responsive Table**

Responsive table to allow users to view class timetable at a glance.

**Contact Form**

Give the user an opportunity to contact the centre directly through a contact form with required fields and a checkbox to cover GDPR.


Future Features
-----------------
- Make the contact form active - allowing it to send the information to either an email address or database.
- Take online bookings for workshops
- Take online bookings for classes
- Add a lightbox feature to the masonary galleries that would allow users to view a bigger version of the image in a lighbox.
